Hall and Sun document the rise of corporate policy teams, showing that firms increasingly invest more in internal political expertise than in traditional lobbying. Berry and Fowler trace the shifting geography of economic productivity and partisan alignment, highlighting how the new political economy of place reshapes distributive politics. Fouirnaies shows how interest group endorsements tilt primary elections, underscorin g how organized groups channel support to favored candidates. Finally, Buisseret presents a formal model of elections in which the incentives of campaigns to raise money from small donors leads to polarized platforms. Together, these papers reveal the diverse ways in which money, expertise, geography, and group support shape contemporary American politics, offering new perspectives on the anatomy of influence beyond the ballot box."
