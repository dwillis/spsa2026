As Aristotle goes on to say, politics is prior by nature to the human being; humanity as such, that is, is impossible without the rational faculty developed by communal living. Speech (logos) comes to sight as logically prior but ontologically posterior to political life: politics is the subject of speech by political philosophers, who debate about justice and the  advantageous, but politics also presupposes the ability to speak and reason about these same subjects. This panel explores speech as both the sine qua non of the practice of politics, and also the means by which theorists treat the subject of political life."
