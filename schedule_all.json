    "title": "Discussants Churchill B2 - 2nd Tanya Buhler Corbin, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Arthur Simental, US Emergency & Disaster Management Congress Disaster management and federal disaster policies are under scrutiny and debate in the U.S., with major institutions and agencies questioning and re-envisioning their structures, roles, and functions. These profound changes in the US emergency management s y stem are occurring at an accelerated pace, with input from the academic and practitioner community largely absent. Instead, disaster and emergency management policies are being developed and enacted based on partisan interests rather than current science and academic research. As disaster policy scholars have established, advocacy groups are necessary for successful policy change, which is lacking in th e disaster policy domain. An effort is now underway to bring together the disaster management community of scholars and practitioners through the United States Emergency & Disaster Management Congress (USEDMC), a nonpartisan, nonprofit professional association dedicated to influencing and shaping policy through legislative advocacy, education, and through the establishment of a unified national emergency & disaster management professional standard known as the \u201cmodel emergency management law\u201d and shared governance. Newly established, USEDMC represents emergency management professionals across the United State s from all U.S. states, territories, and tribes. In this roundtable discussion, we offer an overview of the organization, priorities, and progress of the organization and engage academic and practitioner stakeholders in a discussion of how to successfully ensure a robust, effective, and sustainable emergency and disaster management advocacy organization in the future.",

        "title": "Twentieth-century German political philosophy was profoundly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s recovery of culture as a tool for diagnosing what he took to be the malaise of modern liberal democratic life. This panel explores Nietzsche\u2019s cultural politics and the echoes of a cultural approach to the study of politics in Hannah Arendt\u2019s theory of communication and action, as well as Karl Jaspers\u2019 account of a politics based on finitude. Dwight Allman reconsiders the impact of Nietzsche\u2019s early work The Birth of Tragedy by examining his early notes and unpublished writings (the Nachlass) and finds the roots of Nietzsche\u2019s adoption of ancient Greek tragic culture, which would prove pivotal in his embrace of the persona \u201cthe last disciple of the philosopher Dionysius\u201d in his later works Beyond Good and Evil and Twilight of the Idols. Paul Kirkland explores Nietzsche's argument about the cultural effects of the ascetic ideal which he associates with the modern scientific project. Kirkland argues that in Genealogy of Morals Nietzsche sought to fashion a new appearance for philosophy that does not require the mask of asceticism. Natalie Moreira engages the question of the philosophic meaning of culture by highlighting Arendt\u2019s efforts to frame a political epistemology that can ground the multiple perspectives required to situate oneself in the realm of human affairs. For Moreira, one of Arendt\u2019s signal achievements was to articulate a theory of communication that contributes to the improvised actions reflected in the individual\u2019s right to organize a creative participatory political community. Lee Ward turns to Arendt\u2019s mentor Karl Jaspers. Ward argues that this doyen of abstract existentialist philosophers actually had a very moderate political teaching grounded on his concept of \u201cboundary situations\u201d [Grenzsituationen]. For Jaspers the individual human being can only become an authentic self through a series of \u201cleaps\u201d from self to Existenz framed by the limits placed on action by material, social and political conditions rooted in historical reality. The paper concludes that Jaspers\u2019 politics of finitude offers a compelling response to the integralist political and theological ambitions of many contemporary \u201cpost-liberal\u201d thinkers such as Patrick Deneen and Adrian Vermeule. Taken altogether, the papers in this panel each highlight aspects of the relation of culture and politics that continue to resonate in contemporary life.",

    "section": "Author Meets Critics-The Politics of Individualism Thursday Public Opinion",
    "title": "Individualism is a quintessential American value, manifesting in emphases on hard work and economic independence. But there is another key aspect to individualism: moral autonomy, which must be understood in the context of an individual's relationship to authority. Autonomy has been a central focus for political theory but overlooked in the empirical measures most often used by political scientists The Politics of Individualism (2025, Oxford University Press) emphasizes the importance of moral autonomy by examining the relationship between autonomy, the self, and institutions. The book explores the conceptual dimensions of individualism, introduces a new empirical measure (\"moral individualism\"), and evaluates its relationship to civic life. People who score highly on the moral individualism scale are less likely to commit to public goods and to engage in collective efforts to alleviate common problems, even in the midst of a pandemic that threatened the physical health of millions around the world. In light of these findings, the book assesses the danger that moral individualism may pose to the maintenance of democratic institutions and the common goals and beliefs that help bind a nation together. In this panel, our aim is to explore the empirical advances made in The Politics of Individualism and their implications. Because a central goal of the panel is to bring together both political theorists and empirical political scientists, we anticipate the panel will include both types of scholars. We are still in the process of finalizing the list of critics, but our aim for the panel will be to provide a brief overview of the argument in the book, followed by constructive discussion from each of four critics. Given the content of the book, we view this panel as a unique opportunity to promote dialogue between political philosophers and empirical researchers as they explore the book and its findings. 2600 CwC #7: Wartime Politics Thursday Conference Within A Conference Chair Churchill B1 - 2nd Milan Svolik, Yale University",

The depth of Thucydides\u2019 account of politics and \u201cthe human thing\u201d and the artistry of his text are widely accepted, so the neglect is strange. The Platonic dialogues offer an account of Socrates, who brought philosophy down to the city, and Thucydides, Socrates\u2019 contemporary, is arguably the greatest and certainly the most immediate of Plato\u2019s predecessors. Once the question of their connection is raised signs of Thucydides\u2019 influence on Plato emerge, as do more surprising indications: reading Plato in light of Thucydides allows one to read Thucydides in light of Plato. That is, alertness to Plato\u2019s artistry and to his account of how philosophic questions emerge from political ones allows for a more philosophically rich understanding of the substance and procedure of Thucydides\u2019 text. This panel brings together scholars of Thucydides and Plato to begin to give the connection between the two thinkers it\u2019s due.",

One paper explores how Indigenous Caribbean communities adapt to shifting societal pressures while preserving cultural identity, offering insight into grassroots resilience amid modernization. Another traces Saint Lucia\u2019s democratic evolution, analyzing how small island states navigate global political currents while maintaining institutional stability. A third paper investigates the operational capacity of law enforcement agencies across CARICOM nations in confronting transnational cocaine trafficking, revealing disparities in institutional effectiveness and regional cooperation. The panel also addresses ecological vulnerability through an analysis of foreign overfishing\u2019s impact on Caribbean livelihoods, demonstrating how external exploitation threatens both economic survival and environmental sustainability. Finally, the persistent crisis of human trafficking is examined as a product of poverty, weak governance, and organized crime, underscoring the need for coordinated policy responses. Together, these papers illuminate the complex interplay between external pressures and internal governance, revealing how Caribbean societies confront entrenched vulnerabilities while striving for democratic resilience, social equity, and sustainable development.",

Latin America is experiencing a renewed mining rush, driven by the demand for \u201cgreen energy transition\u201d minerals like lithium, copper, and nickel, while the price of gold has reached historic highs amid geopolitical and geo-economic tensions and uncertainty. However, unlike at the start of the commodity supercycle from 2002-2013, companies seeking to extract these minerals now encounter communities shaped by two decades of conflicts both against mining and over the terms of mining, while debates over the benefits versus harms of extractivism have intensified. At the same time, countries are increasingly engaging in the illicit and unregulated extraction of both old and new commodities, such as gold and copper. With the context more relevant than ever, the papers in the panel place an emphasis on power and the strategic action that communities, corporations, labor organizations, and state entities take as determining the outcomes of extractive politics. These dynamics through how the variation in labor organizing of artisanal gold miners across territories allows or prevents the influence of criminal organizations in Peru (Pe\u00f1a Jimenez); how territorial conflicts and dynamics lead to negotiated, unnegotiated, or aborted lithium projects in the Atacama\u2019s Lithium Triangle of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia (Gonz\u00e1lez and Snyder); how the dynamics of territorial struggles led to near total national paralysis of mining in Guatemala (Edenhofer); how the contradictions of company-community relations create or inhibit mobilization in Chile\u2019s lithium sector (Maasland); and how the attempts to create post- neoliberal green industrial policy in the lithium sector in Chile and California expose the tensions between state-led industrial policy, local opposition, neocolonial structures and geopolitics of critical minerals (Ortega).",

While military success is generally considered essential in winning a conflict, many factors make it challenging to achieve a political outcome that justifies the blood and treasure expended by military operations. Panelists will draw from the conflicts in Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other regions to assess the conditions under which battlefield dominance is a decisive factor in achieving political objectives and when military success fails to produce the desired aims of the belligerents. The following questions will be addressed. Has the nature of modern warfare made military dominance more problematic? How did the political and social context within which the conflict was waged impact its outcome? Where the political aims of the belligerents clearly defined and realistic? Did the adversaries adequately reassess and adapt to changes on the battlefield? Did international institutions and global public opinion play a meaningful role in bring the war to an end?",

Anchored in the Cold War moment, one paper revisits the Bay of Pigs invasion to interrogate John F. Kennedy\u2019s strategic calculus and its implications for U.S.\u2013Cuban relations. Another examines the entanglement of public and private corruption in Cuba, revealing how informal networks and state structures co-evolved under communism. A third contribution traces the enduring influence of the Cuban diaspora on contemporary U.S. foreign policy, highlighting how exile communities have shaped legislative agendas and diplomatic postures. Finally, a legal-historical analysis of gender reforms in revolutionary Cuba assesses both the progressive aspirations and persistent limitations of state-led transformation. Together, these papers present a nuanced portrait of Cuba, not as a static revolutionary symbol, but as a dynamic site of contestation, where ideology, governance, and identity intersect across borders and over decades. By bridging domestic and international perspectives, the panel invites critical reflection on Cuba\u2019s evolving role in global politics and the complex interplay between reform, resistance, and remembrance.",

Kerr (2001), in some of the most well-known literature in this area, highlights the role of universities within society arguing that place and space are central to understanding how HEOs integrate themselves within their societies and communities. From the initial land grant universities to the more recent Carnegie Community Engagement Elective Classification, different models of engagement and impact have been put forth. This panel will explore these models and practices of engagement. The first paper examines the missions of land grant universities, urban-serving universities, extension programs, and engaged scholarship, identifying overlaps and gaps. The next paper focuses on rural community research conducted in West Texas (the Panhandle and South Plains regions), including the presence of third spaces and the strengths and challenges of these communities. The third paper presents how a regional university has implemented a statewide training program for public defenders. The final paper demonstrates how partnering public libraries can fill the engagement gaps, particularly in rural communities. Attendees will be able to take this knowledge back to their own universities and develop and enhance their own projects to engage with their communities.",

As Aristotle goes on to say, politics is prior by nature to the human being; humanity as such, that is, is impossible without the rational faculty developed by communal living. Speech (logos) comes to sight as logically prior but ontologically posterior to political life: politics is the subject of speech by political philosophers, who debate about justice and the advantageous, but politics also presupposes the ability to speak and reason about these same subjects. This panel explores speech as both the sine qua non of the practice of politics, and also the means by which theorists treat the subject of political life.",

Yon, United States Military Academy This panel will feature a robust discussion of Saladin Ambar's recent book, Murder on the Mississippi: The Shocking Crimes that Shaped Abraham Lincoln (Diversion). Amid the string of murders on the American frontier, Lincoln faced the loss of his first love\u2014and a descent into suicidal despair. Yet from this darkness, he emerged with a renewed purpose, one that would define his leadership in the fight for democracy, human freedom, and the rule of law. In Murder on the Mississippi, Ambar unearths the horrors that shaped a young Abraham Lincoln\u2019s worldview, pushing him to find his political voice in one of the earliest and most pivotal speeches of his career. Confronted by lawlessness, racial terror, and his own inner demons, Lincoln\u2019s battle was political and deeply personal. From the flames of mob violence rose a young Lincoln, forged in fire and soon to contend with a nation at war with itself. 3700 Access to Justice: Representation in the Courts Friday Judicial Politics",

The final paper analyzes how the Trump administration exposed the fragility of congressional oversight, and offers historical and practical reforms to strengthen investigative capacity in the face of executive resistance. Together, these papers offer a roadmap for rebalance congressional and executive power, focusing on expertise, procedural muscle, and institutional resilience in the post-Chevron era.",

Dr. Rachel Mackey (Hudson Institute) articulates Aristotle \u2019 s understanding of the fundamental conditions for political life and asks whether the classical notion of politics still exists, or indeed can exist, in the modern age. Dr. J. Michael Hoffpauir (University of Austin) explores in Machiavelli \u2019 s mentions of \u201c knives \u201d his modern conceptions of fortune, god, cruelty, and the divine. Janet Dougherty (St. John \u2019 s College, Annapolis) concludes with a book that bridges ancient and modern thought, Montesquieu \u2019 s Persian Letters . She inquire s about the relationship between the modern scientific method and ancient philosophy \u2019 s quest for self - knowledge, as well as between despotism and enlightened government. Taken together, these presentations aim to present ancient and modern conceptions of politics and philosophy and ask what students of politics can learn by putting them in dialogue with one another. Panel members will respond to one another.",

Emma Bernstien MacFarlane asks whether \u201c lightheartedness [is] something Xenophon understands to be a necessary part of the good life, \u201d and why Socrates countenances the presence of lighthearted men in his company. Maria Goyette (Baylor University, fellow at Cleveland State University) takes up how Aristotle \u2019 s moral education aims to refine the quality of spiritedness, so important to politics and a well - ordered soul. These presentations will suggest how Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle shape the education of the philosopher while articulating the shocking claim that philosophy is essential for politics.",

This session will provide a practical overview of applying for research support in political science from two high-profile funders of social, political and policy research. The panel includes (1) program staff from from the National Science Foundation and the Russell Sage Foundation, and (2) academic scholars who have applied for and received funding as well as served as reviewers for the process. Funder panelists will discuss their funding priorities, the grant writing and review process and the basics of what makes a good grant proposal, processes for developing ideas for funding and budgeting, and resources that specify what to include in research proposals. With extensive funding experience and evaluating proposals as part of the grant-making process, funder panelists will discuss how to develop and write a sound grant application from the perspective of a funding organization. Scholar panelists will discuss and provide insights about the application and review process from the grant-seeking side. A key focus will be on tips for good grant-writing \u2013 the specifics of what often makes for a good grant proposal and the mistakes that grant-seekers should avoid in drafting an application.",

    "title": "Chair Magazine - 3rd Ann Ward, Baylor University Discussants Rebecca LeMoine, Florida Atlantic University Robert Ballingall, University of Maine Alex Orwin, Louisiana State University Mary Townsend, St. john's University Given the rise of illiberalism, nativism, and authoritarianism in our politics today, bringing with it the attack on the \u201cwoke\u201d concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion and promises of the detention and mass deportations of immigrants, it is all the more imperative that we reflect on the impact of Plato\u2019s Caves: The Liberating Sting of Cultural Diversity (Oxford University Press, 2020) by Rebecca LeMoine. In Plato\u2019s Caves, LeMoine argues, contrary to the popular and scholarly narrative, that Plato was a friend of cultural diversity. Through a careful reading of four Platonic dialogues, the Republic, Menexenus, Laws, and Phaedrus, LeMoine shows that far from exhibiting hostility toward foreigners, they reveal that foreigners paly a role similar to that of Socrates: the role of gadfly. Like encounters with Socrates, interactions with foreigners can expose contradictions in the authoritative opinions that undergird one\u2019s political community and thus encourage a more self-reflective citizenship. They can do this, according to LeMoine, because every citizen lives in a polity that shares the basic features of the cave, Plato\u2019s famous allegory in the Republic. This means that when we interact with someone raised in a different \u201ccave,\u201d we are faced with the possibility of another way of life and hence with the occasion to reflect on our own conception of truth, beauty, and goodness. Foreigners, in other words, help us to see our cave as a cave, hence showing us that we live in a world of cave-like polities from which we can nonetheless be freed. LeMoine also argues that studying Plato\u2019s views on foreigner\u2019s gives deeper insight into his attitudes toward democracy, and concludes with reflections on how Plato\u2019s portrayal of foreigners as gadflies can speak to our contemporary debate on cultural diversity. According to LeMoine, Plato shows how the \u201cliberating sting\u201d of cross-cultural engagement, although initially painful, can help citizens cultivate a Socratic knowledge of ignorance and hence the intellectual humility that is essential to the preservation of democracy. Plato, LeMoine argues, shows that democracy\u2019s downfall into tyranny happens when citizens develop intellectual hubris that rejects education and the exposure to cultural diversity that it brings.",

Fouirnaies shows how interest group endorsements tilt primary elections, underscoring how organized groups channel support to favored candidates. Finally, Buisseret presents a formal model of elections in which the incentives of campaigns to raise money from small donors leads to polarized platforms.

It is intended as a step towards developing a set of validation practices and standards for working with generative AI tools in political science. Work using generative AI tools in political science has dramatically increased, but researchers still lack a set of best practices to validate and justify the use of generative AI tools in their many applications. This leaves scholars, reviewers, funders, and the discipline at large unsure how to evaluate the quality of research using generative AI in political science. We intend for the scope of this conversation to include best practices and evaluation standards related, but not limited, to: extent and disclosure of AI use in the research process, transparency and replicability, metrics and benchmarks for task - specific performance, and model selection",

This panel brings together research on Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil to examine the politics between victims, movements, and politicians in contexts of conflict and insecurity. In Colombia, unarmed movements mobilize for land redistribution even amid armed conflict to achieve redistributive reform through peace processes. In some parts of Mexico, victims and local communities leverage violence through extralegal practice to engage with or pressure state institutions, while in others, they organize collectively but deliberately avoid state institutions. In Brazil, politicians strategically deploy repression-based appeals that influence public support for police violence and shape attitudes toward police reforms. Taken together, these studies show how citizens and elites negotiate the terms of violence and order, with consequences for redistribution, state accountability, and democratic governance in Latin America.",
